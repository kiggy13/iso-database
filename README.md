11Alot of Operating System ISO Files, even modded versions. This was made so you don't have to go to different sketchy websites to find ISO files.
The pre-installed versions require VMware, you can either install VMware and use the free VMware player or go to the [product keys file](https://github.com/kiggy13/iso-database/files/9131619/product.keys.txt) and enter the free VMware workstation 16 key.

**SOME ISO FILES HAVE NOT BEEN UPLOADED YET, THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING UPLOADED.**

**Install ISO Files from [Icedrive](https://icedrive.net/s/bF2N89QhaG2vTkjQXGTQSA3ACYia), [the installer](https://github.com/kiggy13/iso-database/blob/main/Installer.exe?raw=true) or from [the install link text file.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiggy13/iso-database/main/install%20link.txt)**

Some of the different Windows Versions require product keys. You can get the Windows XP Professional, Windows ME, Windows 95 and Windows 7 product keys from the [product keys file](https://github.com/kiggy13/iso-database/files/9131619/product.keys.txt). There are some versions like Windows 2000 Advanced Server and Windows 2000 Professional that I do not have a product key for. The Windows 10 free activation method is also in the [product keys file](https://github.com/kiggy13/iso-database/files/9131619/product.keys.txt). I also found another product keys text file online, [Mediafire Link](https://www.mediafire.com/file/xt54dip6ut2tnga/Keys.txt/file), [Github Raw Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiggy13/iso-database/main/Keys.txt).
